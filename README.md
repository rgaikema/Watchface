# Watchface

## My first custom Garmin watchface

My goal is:

* Create a basic custom watchface
* Learn a bit of programming along the way
* Keep the power consumption of the watchface low

This an experiment and WIP so there ~~can~~ will be bugs in it.
I tested this only on a Venu 2S and con confirm that the watchface works on this device.
